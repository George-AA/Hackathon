# Hackathon

## Description

This project analyzes survey data to assess personality traits and smoking dependence using custom Python scripts. The project processes responses from a survey, maps them to numerical scores, and normalizes the data to provide insights into personality traits (based on the Big Five model) and smoking habits. It is intended to demonstrate data processing, scoring, and normalization techniques.

## Features

Personality Trait Analysis: Scores for Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, and Openness are calculated from survey responses.
Smoking Dependence Scoring: Measures levels of smoking dependence using survey responses on smoking habits and history.
Data Normalization: Personality and smoking dependence scores are normalized to a range of 0 to 100.

## Usage

Place the survey file (2024_PersonalityTraits_SurveyData.xls) in the data/ folder.
Open the Jupyter Notebook notebook.ipynb to see the full process for loading, scoring, and normalizing the data.
Run the notebook to generate the normalized personality and dependence scores.
